This extension scans your `/etc/ssh/config` and `~/.ssh/config` and makes your ssh hosts accessible by Albert.

Type the trigger `ssh` and albert will list all your ssh hosts. When you type another word this word is used to filter the hosts by prefix match. There is one additional item that uses the complete second word as host. This item is intended to quick connect to undefined hosts.

Parameters are not allowed. To use parameters you may want to use the terminal extension or just start a terminal.
