This extension lets you control your VirtualBox VMs. It supports various states in which the VM can be:
- starting/restoring/saving/stopping : All controls are disabled
- poweroff/aborted/saved : This VM can be **started**
- running : This VM can be **paused**, saved and stopped
- paused : This VM can be **resumed**, saved and reset

The **bold** options are the main actions that will get executed if the entry is hit. The other ones are alternative actions.

Type in the name of the VM you want to manipulate and an entry will appear.
