Albert Python module interface specification v0.4

To work as an albert extension Python modules have to have a particular
interface described below. The Python extension also defines an embedded module
albert which allows the Python modules to interact with the core. The interface
specification and the built-in albert module are versioned together and form the
versioned Python interface. The Python interface is not final. They are
prototypes and intended to be improved on user feedback.

This file is a .pyi declaration of the interface, suitable for use with mypy
type checkers, as well as Python language servers which provide completion. It
contains inline documentation copied from the README [1].

[1]: https://github.com/albertlauncher/plugins/tree/master/python

The following portion of the docstring describes the variables and functions
which each Python extension module must implement. The remainder of this file's
contents are the declarations of the albert module itself.

Variables:

__doc__       Optional [string]. The docstring of the module is used as
              description of the extension. This string will be displayed to the
              user.
__title__     MANDATORY [string]. This variable should hold the pretty name of
              the extension. This string will be displayed to the user.
__version__   MANDATORY [string]. The versioning scheme should be
              [iid_major].[iid_minor].[verion]. The interface id (iid_*) should
              match the pyton interface version. version is the extensions
              version.
              Note that within each iid_maj the API is backwards compatible, but
              as long as albert is in alpha stage iid_major will be 0 and API
              may brake any time.
__triggers__  Optional [string, list of strings]. If this extension should be
              run exclusively, this variable has to hold the trigger that causes
              the extension to be executed.
__authors__   Optional [string, list of strings]. This variable should hold the
              name of the author of the extension.
__exec_deps__ Optional [string, list of strings]. This string should contain any
              dependencies the extension needs to be used. The name of the
              dependency has to match the name of the executable in $PATH.
__py_deps__   Optional [string, list of strings]. This string should contain any
              dependencies the extension needs to be used. The name of the
              dependency has to match the name of the package in the PyPI.

Functions:

handleQuery(Query) MANDATORY. This is the crucial part of a Python module. When
                   the user types a query, this function is called with a query
                   object representing the current query execution. This
                   function should return a list of Item objects.  See the Item
                   class section below.
initialize()       Optional. This function is called when the extension is
                   loaded. Although you could technically run your
                   initialization code in global scope, it is recommended to
                   initialize your extension in this function. If your extension
                   fails to initialize you can raise exceptions here, which are
                   displayed to the user.
finalize()         Optional. This function is called when the extension is
                   unloaded.
